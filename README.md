Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a developer/sysadmin from Portugal, passionate about Open Source, coding and music/audio.

#### ðŸŒ± Allways learning...

There's always room for some more knowledge.
Here are some of the topics I'm always trying to learn/improve:
- Linux (mostly Debian/Ubuntu and RHEL/Fedora)
- Anything Linux related
- Docker
- K8s
- Ansible
- Python
- Bash scripting
- A.I.
- DevOps
- Music/Audio

(Bigger list than what I anticipated! :sweat_smile:)

#### âš¡ Fun facts:
