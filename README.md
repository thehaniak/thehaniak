I'm a developer/sysadmin from Portugal, passionate about Open Source, coding and music/audio.

### 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ...

I'm currently looking to collaborate on an interesting Open Source project.
Due to my interest in music/audio, I'm currently helping to translate [Finamp](https://github.com/jmshrv/finamp) to Portuguese (Portugal).

But let me know if you need an extra brain to help on your project!!

### 🌱 I’m currently learning ...

There's always room for some more knowledge.
Here are some of the topics I'm always trying to learn/improve:
- Linux (mostly Debian/Ubuntu and RHEL/Fedora)
- Anything Linux related
- Docker
- K8s
- Ansible
- Python
- Bash scripting
- A.I.
- DevOps
- Music/Audio

(Bigger list than what I anticipated! :sweat_smile:)
